## Description

[Portfolio](https://jeanarose.github.io/portfolio/) is a webpage that showcases my software development work. My Portfolio was designed to be a responsive webpage using primarily Bootstrap. Several components were used to make this webpage responsive and follow best coding practices such as:

- Use of the Bootstrap grid system to optimize responsiveness, specifically a collapsible navigation bar and defined breakpoints for best visuals at each screen size
- A consistent navigation bar across all webpages
- Semantic HTML elements
- A sticky footer
- Comments to break-up sections for future software developers to understand the code better
- CSS organized by specificty
- An HTML validation service to ensure best HTML practices

During the development of this website, the value of the grid system was evident and utilized throughout.
