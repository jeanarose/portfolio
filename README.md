## Description

[Portfolio](https://jeanarose.github.io/portfolio/) is a webpage that showcases my software development work. Portfolio was designed to be a responsive webpage using primarily React and Bulma. Several components were used to make this webpage responsive and follow best coding practices such as:

- React components, state, and hooks
- Use of Bulma classes
- A consistent navigation bar across all webpages
- Semantic HTML elements
